//! Locale wiring for the dashboard.
//!
//! The catalogue loading and the policy live in
//! [`real_estate_allocation_core::i18n`], shared with the embed bundle. What is
//! here is only what differs per surface: this crate's own `messages/`, which the
//! page bundle's `mfe!` resolves against the host's `<html lang>`.
//!
//! The property dataset in [`store`](crate::store) is content authored per
//! building, not chrome, so it does not live here. Its two prose fields — terms
//! and reasoning — are translated per record in [`translations`](crate::translations),
//! the same route publication cards took. Project names and developers are
//! proper nouns and stay as written.
